For example, to install with Pathogen:\r\n\r\n    cd ~/.vim/bundle\r\n    git clone git://github.com/avdgaag/vim-lucky-markdown.git\r\n\r\nFor more information on how these plugin managers work, please refer to their\r\ndocumentation.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to or cannot use such plugin managers, simply copy the files\r\nfrom this repository to their respective locations in `~/.vim`:\r\n\r\n    cp plugin/lucky-markdown.vim ~/.vim/plugin\r\n    cp doc/lucky-markdown.txt ~/.vim/doc\r\n\r\nTo generate the helptags for this help file, see |:helptags|.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAfter installing the plugin, an `omnicomplete` function is automatically\r\nconfigured for Markdown documents. You can invoke it with CTRL-X CTRL-O (see\r\n`i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O`) after your started writing a Markdown link.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can complete the following two link syntaxes (the | is the\r\ncurrent cursor):\r\n\r\n    [Ruby]:|\r\n    [Ruby](\r\n\r\nThis will result in the following completed text:\r\n\r\n    [Ruby]: http://ruby-lang.org\r\n    [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)\r\n\r\nThe text between the brackets will be used as the search query.\r\n\r\nNote the completion function is only set in files with `filetype` markdown. To\r\nenable it elsewhere, simply set `omnifunc` to `CompleteMarkdownLink`.\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\n**Author**: Arjan van der Gaag  \r\n**License**: MIT license  \r\n**Issues**: http://github.com/avdgaag/vim-lucky-markdown/issues  \r\n**Source**: http://github.com/avdgaag/vim-lucky-markdown\r\n","google":"UA-20357800-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
